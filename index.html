                    “I have no time!”
<br><br>
On the thirtieth of May, 1832, A twenty-year old French artillery guard scrawled these words in the margins of his parting letters—<a href = "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galois/">on the eve of his death</a>. His name was Évariste Galois. In the three letters addressed to his friends and correspondents, he made several emotional farewells and penned his last regrets. One of the letters featured an earnest plea for his former schoolmate, to deliver a bundle of papers on his behalf to physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss and mathematician Carl Jacobi. The papers contained his life’s work in mathematics. Most of it unpublished.
<br><br>
The next morning, as Galois walked off into the mist of the Parisian country, he could not have shaken the dread from him. It was the type of dread felt exclusively by the damned, as their minds dashed to reconcile the fragments of their lives, clawing for a reason; a reassurance that their names wouldn’t be lost to the wind. 
<br><br>
He was shot and left by the road.
<br><br>
In what would later become one of the most infamous duels in the history of mathematics, Galois, a bright young student, was swiftly robbed of his future. A future that, by many accounts, would have been invaluable to the field.
<br><br>
Born in 1811 on the south end of the capital, in Bourg-la-Reine, Galois was already at the doorstep of Europe’s leading community of scientists. Working in France at the time was an armada of now-household disciples and mathematical juggernauts, including the likes of <a href = "https://shellbuckling.com/cv/cauchy.pdf">Augustin-Louis Cauchy</a>, and <a href = "https://web.mat.upc.edu/eva.miranda/Catalogue_English.pdf">Siméon Denis Poisson</a>.
<br><br>
However blossoming Europe’s scholars were, the fallout from the Reign of Terror was still shredding through Paris, and the ruins of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> loomed high above. In 1814, King Louis XVIII restored the monarchy on moderate terms, seeking to appease revolutionaries while still preserving the dynasty. But following the election of 1815, the legislature was inundated with a <a href = "http://www.1066.co.nz/Mosaic%20DVD/whoswho/text/Louis_XVIII_of_France[1].htm">band of Ultras</a> (ultraloyalists) so numerous that Louis had no choice but to dissolve parliament. The government was in shambles again.
<br><br>
Amidst the political turmoil, twelve-year old Galois was sent off to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, a boarding school on the Seine. Among the things he missed most was his father Nicolas, a cheerful and lauded mayor of Bourg-la-Reine, who’d often amuse his colleagues with his poetic epigrams. Although Galois couldn’t care less about politics, <a href = "https://www.damninteresting.com/radical-solutions/">many accounts</a> point to his father’s revolutionary ideals rubbing off on him.
<br><br>
The Lycée was a middle-rate primary school whose crowning virtue was order and discipline, having graduated Voltaire and the revolutionary shark <a href = "https://www.city-journal.org/article/why-robespierre-chose-terror">Maximilian Robespierre</a>. Bread and water for breakfast, eggs and vegetables for lunch, all-silent meals and duly-punished perpetrators—and at the end of the week, rice pudding for the most loyal subjects. The school had twelve prison cells, in which one could earn themselves a stay following any instance of 1) chewing too loudly, 2) not finishing a meal, or 3) tossing in bed. It may not come as a surprise that almost none of the cells were ever empty.
<br><br>
Despite its austerity, the school’s barely-teenage pupils were brimming with radical ideologies. This, coupled with the charged political atmosphere, was a recipe for some rather awkward student-staff interactions (including a deputy headmaster almost getting thrown out a window). Multiple in-school riots saw quick expulsions from unyielding staff, as well as children dying to “fight alongside Napoleon” in the reclamation of France. In one particularly bizarre case, all 75 of the school’s top-performing students were expelled on the spot following a <a href = "https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=zCjyBwAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright#v=onepage&q&f=false">conspiratorial prank</a> against the headmaster. 
<br><br>
Having learned Latin and Greek from his mother, Galois managed to scrape by in this new hellscape, even earning some approving letters from his teachers. But it was his love of language that eventually helped him transition to mathematics. One of the courses introduced Galois to Adrien Legendre’s <em>Éléments de géométrie</em>, a rearrangement and simplification of Euclid’s famous <em>Elements</em>—a work that is still widely regarded as one of the <a href = "https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=382">greatest textbooks</a> of all time. Legendre’s abridged version was designed to be studied during a four-semester college course, but as rumor would have it, a 15-year old Galois plowed through the text in two days. What is certain is that he absorbed all of its content and thereafter became helplessly bound by its allure. The mysterious world of geometry had unfolded before him, and he wanted nothing more than to set sail among its pillars; chart a course through its heart. 
<br><br>
In what can only be described as a fit of addiction, Galois abandoned all his classes in the name of this newfound escape. He began reading the original works of <a href = "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lagrange/">Joseph-Louis Lagrange</a>, a name stamped in many corners of physics and mathematics today. 
<br><br>
As his interest in non-mathematical studies drained, Galois suffered under the school’s disciplinary obsessions. His regular detentions provoked a range of descriptions from his humanities instructors: “He is under the spell of mathematics. [. . .] There is nothing in his work except strange fantasies and negligence; he always does what he should not do. [. . .]  His ambition, his frequently ostentatious originality, his bizarre character keep him isolated from his school fellows.” He must have <em>really</em> managed to irritate them, given that his own teachers were now criticizing him for being original.
<br><br>
In June of 1828, at the age of 16, against the advice of his superiors, Galois took the <a href = https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Strick/galois.pdf>entrance exam</a> for the École Polytechnique of Paris—one of Europe’s leading colleges. It was an oral exam in which candidates produced a series of mathematical proofs for a panel of examiners, with nothing but a piece of chalk, a blackboard, and their mind to help them. Acceptance was so competitive that applicants were permanently barred from entry after just two failed attempts. Besides the École’s rich academic offering, it was a lone revolutionary pinnacle in an ocean of growing loyalist institutions. Legislative tides waned for the republic, and day by day, the Ultras slipped themselves back into powerful positions. The École was a potential haven for Galois, and, in all respects, a dream school.
<br><br>
He failed the exam.
<br><br>
Even for the brightest, it required an exceptional study regime and willingness to train like a star athlete, something he did not yet possess. Galois was what many would call an <em>intuitive</em> student—one who relied on a deep and innate feeling of truth rather than a broad knowledge of the landscape. He didn’t learn things because he was told them; he learned things because he had cracked their secrets through his own deductions. 
<br><br>
Disappointed, he resolved to make a herculean effort over the next few months, working only on mathematics, to secure what he believed was his rightful place among his sharp-minded equals and political breed. Come next year, his final chance would be upon him.
<br><br>
It was at this point that he began work on the theory which would later etch his name among the immortals of his discipline. Having developed a pristine understanding of geometry, Galois threw this knowledge full-force into analyzing the roots (solutions) of polynomial equations. Although his methods were more nuanced, the gist of the work revolved around a singular realization: the roots of polynomial equations were somehow, and seemingly out of nowhere, related to the symmetries of regular polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, .  . .). A discovery of this caliber would surely vault him through the gates of the École.

            The symmetries of polygons are the basis on which Galois built the idea of a <em>group</em> and which would later underpin ideas of symmetry found in <em>abstract algebra</em>. Shown in the image are the reflectional symmetries of a triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon.

Much like star athletes, prospective mathematicians found mentors to coach them and “referee” their papers. Galois chose possibly the most difficult target he could have, opting for Augustin-Louis Cauchy. As a current professor of the École, Cauchy had gained infamy for his aggressively-abstract lectures, jam-packed with the most obscure of ideas, and directed only at the hardiest of his students. Known to dismiss all current research other than his own, Cauchy was perhaps the paragon of academic snobbery.
<br><br>
After a series of complicated interactions, and, seeing the potential importance of the work, Cauchy agreed to present Galois’ manuscript at the next meeting for the Academy of Sciences. But an ill-fated sickness held the professor home the day of the presentation, and the following week he was scheduled to present his own work again. Galois’ ideas were <a href = "https://www.target.com/p/symmetry-by-marcus-du-sautoy-paperback/-/A-77247401">left in the shadows</a> along with his manuscript, which, as some historians conjecture, was also left to languish in Cauchy’s office.
<br><br>
Also working in Paris at the time was none other than mathematician <a href = "https://www.ravepubs.com/joseph-fourier-father-digital-audio-processing/">Joseph Fourier</a>, the super-star whose work can be thanked for the noise-canceling tech found in today’s high-end headphones. Galois produced another manuscript for Fourier’s supervision, but luck failed him again. After taking the paper home for evaluation, Fourier passed away from stomach cancer, and the manuscript was never retrieved.
<br><br>
Around this time, Galois found his hometown under fire from the local Ultra movement. Galois’ father, Nicolas, continued to preside as mayor, unaware that a <a href = "https://www.damninteresting.com/radical-solutions/">sly Catholic priest</a> had inserted himself into the ranks. Even in the liberal Bourg-la-Reine, the Ultras thrived under emboldening legislation from King Charles X, and they chided the mayor’s revolutionary sympathies.  
 
In conspiracy with the Ultras, the priest forged Nicolas’ signature under snippets of obscenity-loaded poetry, which were then sent out for public circulation. According to <a href = "https://palmer.wellesley.edu/~ivolic/pdf/Classes/MATH306GaloisTheorySpring12/Handouts/GaloisBio.pdf">one source</a>, within days Nicolas’ reputation had fallen to the level of “town crackpot.” The act was even more merciless and heartbreaking, given his honorable character and dedication to the role of governance. The scandal routed him from his home, and not long after he was left roaming the hostels of Paris. Weeks later, feeling there was nothing left of him, he committed suicide.
<br><br>
Protests raged at the funeral and many took up stones against the priest. An overwhelming portion of the town pitched in money to erect a funerary monument for Nicolas. But his father was gone, and Galois was left in shock. 
<br><br>
His second examination was rapidly approaching—a final attempt at the École Polytechnique. Some of the examination boards were known for their bureaucratic inclinations, and the one Galois received spoke thoroughly of this standard. Upon being asked to develop the theory of logarithms from scratch, Galois presented an alternative method which deviated from traditional textbooks, rousing criticism from one examiner. A fiery discussion ensued between the two, and Galois hurled an eraser at him, briskly ending the exam.
<br><br>
He could only watch as his most cherished dream slipped like sand between his fingers.
<br><br>
In the following months, Galois was left to wander the academic backwaters of Paris, alternating between his mathematics and his growing political activism. He became a member of La Société des Amis du Peuple (“Friends of the People”), a revolutionary club. 
<br><br>
While enrolled in the École Normale in 1830, Galois heard the July Revolution rip through the streets. As his fellows at the École Polytechnique spearheaded the riot and wrote history, Galois was forced to sit soundly behind locked doors, like a civilian in danger. Taken by his growing urge to be the danger, he harangued the headmaster and attempted to scale the courtyard walls, unsuccessfully.  
<br><br>
In the following months he kept up his political enthusiasm, frequenting the taverns of his fellow Amis du Peuple, and enrolling in the anarchical National Guard as an artillery specialist. Such was a satisfying  culmination in his thirst for influence. At a particularly clamorous and alcohol-assisted gathering for La Société, Galois made a sudden toast to King Phillipe, which had his anti-loyalist comrades almost fall out of their skins. But after the silence came the resounding cheers of the republic—for they had seen the dagger hidden in his hand.
<br><br>
Galois was arrested following his outright threat on the king’s life. Thanks to the work of a clever defense lawyer, he was spared a prison sentence. Also rushing to his aide was a friend <a href = "https://www.damninteresting.com/radical-solutions/">Auguste Chevalier</a> from the École Normale, who wrote in the <em>Le Globe</em> newspaper an additional defense: “[Galois] felt the germs of a brilliant future but with neither protectors nor friends, he nurtured violent hatred of the regime.” As his mother would recount, Galois spoke and carried himself in an increasingly unhinged manner.
<br><br>
Although making monumental progress on his theorems, Galois lost more manuscripts to the black holes that were the academy’s offices. Now it was Sylvestre Lacroix’s and Siméon Denis Poisson’s. Despite this, Poisson managed to produce one of the few and only evaluations on Galois’ papers. Having been caught loaded with weapons and boasting the (banned) uniform of the National Guard, Galois was now in prison. It was behind bars that Galois read Poisson’s evaluations: “His thesis is neither clear enough, nor sufficiently developed to enable us to judge its rigor [...] one should rather wait for the author to publish his work in its entirety before forming a definite opinion.”
<br><br>
After nine months, Galois was freed. He worked sporadically on his theorems, devoting most of his time to the meetings of La Société, while staying at the prison’s clinic. <a href = "https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_aug.html">Stéphanie DuMotel</a>, the young daughter of a clinician, took interest in him, and the two of them mingled in a confusing relationship full of impulses and miscommunications. He thoroughly loved her and was even distraught by her indifferences, as reflected in a short <a href = "https://www.damninteresting.com/radical-solutions/">flurry of letters</a> between the two. Stéphanie broke off not long after. 
<br><br>
A heartsick Galois trudged on to his meetings. By mid May of 1932, Galois had risen to prominence in La Société des Amis du Peuple, which found itself under a new and pressing problem. Despite preparations for an armed uprising, revolutionary fervor was stalling out in Paris. A member of the meeting pointed out, rather morbidly, that not enough people were dying.
<br><br>
Perhaps with the help of a drink or two, this joke quickly devolved into a full-fledged course of action.
<br><br>
It was decided that La Société needed an excuse to go ballistic. 
<br><br>
A corpse to avenge. A name they could chant to ignite the masses, as they armed themselves for the last hurrah, and as they went out in glory against their enemies. It was another chance to take back what the monarchy had twice robbed of them—and they needed a name to put “on the lips of the dying.”
<br><br>
Galois offered his.
<br><br>
In the coming weeks, his band of revolutionaries orchestrated a plot in which Galois would be killed in a duel, presumably for non-political reasons. Galois used his recent feud with Stéphanie to form a convincing narrative around the circumstances of the bout. In his final letters, he asserts himself the victim of a “cruel coquette” (a bitch), and alludes to being forced to defend her honor over another lover. Many 19th-century duels were fought for expressly similar reasons—insults, challenges, and love-triangles (It also wasn’t uncommon for mathematicians to duel one another over who’s name should title a contested theorem). Although scarcely discussed in the literature, the reason for such a cover-up may have been to throw off any political suspicions from the police, to obscure the imminent uprising. The fact that so many early historians fell for Galois’ forgeries remains a testament to his cunning. <a href = "https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/mathematics/evariste-galois-the-adolescent-who-revolutionized-mathematics/">Numerous</a> <a href = "https://www.damninteresting.com/radical-solutions/">secondary</a> <a href = "https://palmer.wellesley.edu/~ivolic/pdf/Classes/MATH306GaloisTheorySpring12/Handouts/GaloisBio.pdf">sources</a> today still mistakenly declare the duel as romantically-motivated, among other falsehoods.
<br><br>
He knew his theorems were correct. He knew they were of importance to mathematics. As to whether someone would finally catch on to them, he was lost to that cause. Exhausted, unappreciated, and heartbroken. There was nothing left to hope for; nothing left to do. Nothing, but to die for the Republic, for which his father had. It was the lack of a stable foundation underneath his feet, and his own fierce political militancy, which willed him forward into the mist that morning, the gun tucked into his belt. He could not escape the fury of revolution. It had immersed and corrupted him; it coursed through his being.
<br><br>
The duel went as planned. One loaded pistol, one unloaded pistol. From a distance of 25 strides, Galois drew his empty weapon on one of his comrades from La Société. Beside the initials L.D, the precise identity of this conspirator—Galois’ killer—remains <a href = "https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/mathematics/evariste-galois-the-adolescent-who-revolutionized-mathematics/#:~:text=His%20father%2C%20the%20republican%20Nicolas,la%2DReine%2C%20near%20Paris">unverified</a>.
<br><br>
A few hours after the shot, a passing farmer spotted Galois, abandoned in the grass with a stomach wound. He was rushed to the Cochin hospital, an establishment known for treating George Orwell just three years prior (an experience that inspired him to write his <a href = "https://hekint.org/2017/02/01/how-the-poor-die-by-george-orwell-1946/">essay</a>, “How the Poor Die"). Galois declined last rites and held close to his brother, Alfred, during his final moments. “Don’t cry,” Galois said. “I need all my courage to die at twenty.”
<br><br>
One of the few pieces of evidence to hint at the duel’s orchestration was what Galois left in the letter to Auguste Chevalier: “Pardon for those who killed me. They were acting in good faith.” 
<br><br>
Just days after Galois’ death, a beloved revolutionary general, <a href= "https://www.frenchempire.net/biographies/lamarque/">Maximilien Lamarque</a>, passed on his deathbed. As the rebellion neared, the revolutionaries settled on a fateful—and tragic—decision. Having been known by many more people, this new death was a greater opportunity on which to anchor the uprising. They decided to postpone the rebellion and use Lamarque’s funeral as the catalyst instead, rendering the young mathematician’s sacrifice a complete misfire. 
<br><br>
Galois’ funeral ended in quiet and solitude.
<br><br>
Despite this turn of events, Galois' frantically-written letters secured perhaps his most sincere wish. His friend, Auguste Chevalier, recieved the letters and published them in the <em>Revue encyclopédique</em>. The included theorems eventually intruiged <a href = "https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Liouville/">Joseph Liouville</a> in 1843, spurring him to champion the work and pave the way for Galois' legacy.
<br><br>
Prior mathematicians had referred to similar collections of geometric symmetries, but it was Galois who first named them <a href = "https://math.mit.edu/~jwellens/Group%20Theory%20Forum.pdf"> <em>groups</em> </a> and demonstrated their power in analyzing polynomial equations. Despite its simplicity, this is the discovery that, ten years after his death, would begin to steer the helm of mathematics into novel waters—the field known today as <a href = "https://math.berkeley.edu/~apaulin/AbstractAlgebra.pdf"> <em>abstract algebra</em> </a>. The more general field of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05923.pdf"> <em>category theory</em> </a> bloomed from this and now has extensive applications in computer science and other modern branches of mathematics. Today for instance, some of its ideas apply to chemical reaction networks and natural language processing. The fact that Galois managed to develop the foundations of an entire field of mathematics in just three years, from the age of seventeen to twenty, while also drowning in the chaos of the July Revolution, is in itself astounding. 
<br><br>
But as is wont with history’s poster children, the hidden talent never saw the world’s eye until decades after burial. Whether the fault lies with the loss of his manuscripts, or his exclusion from the École Polytechnique, Galois’ unraveling may be attributed to the animosity of the times. The French Revolution and its following years witnessed humans at the peak of their cruelty, and its storied accounts stand as some of the most tragic. There ended the life of a curious boy, a pupil of science, strafed and stolen by the politics of his era—compelled to a death as pointless as it was heartrending. Such was the fate of a child, born amid a storm and forever marred by its warfare.
